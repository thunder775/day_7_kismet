//TODO: Step 4 - Create a new class called StoryBrain. Make sure the storyData variable is inside the class and uncomment it

// TODO: Step 5 - Create class methods, getStory(), getChoice1() and getChoice2() which returns first storyTitle, first choice1 and first choice2 from storyData

// TODO: Step 7 - Create a property called storyNumber which starts with a value of 0. This will be used to track which story the user is currently viewing. Update getStory, getChoice1 and getChoice2 to use this storyNumber to return the value

// TODO: Step 8 - Create a method called nextStory(), it should not have any outputs but it should have 1 input called choiceNumber which will be the choice number (int) made by the user.

// TODO: Step 10 - Download the story plan here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6b8P6kyk_l36TT6XsIS8Su3qDMjG-AB/view?usp=sharing and using the story plan, update nextStory() to change the storyNumber depending on the choice made by the user. e.g. if choiceNumber was equal to 1 and the storyNumber is 0, the storyNumber should become 2.

// TODO: Step 11 - In nextStory() if the storyNumber is equal to 3 or 4 or 5, that means it's the end of the game and it should call a method called restart() that resets the storyNumber to 0. (Create the method called restart)

// TODO: Step 12 - Run the app and try to figure out what code you need to add to this file to make the story change when you press on the choice buttons.

// TODO: Step 13 -  Create a method called buttonShouldBeVisible() which checks to see if storyNumber is 0 or 1 or 2 (when both buttons should show choices) and return true if that is the case, else it should return false.
